	default m

          This adds support for SOF
          Say Y if you have such a device.
          If unsure select "N".

config SND_SOC_SOF_NOCODEC
	tristate "SOF nocodec mode Support"
	depends on SND_SOC_SOF
	help
          This adds support for a dummy/nocodec machine driver fallback
	  option if no known codec is detected. This is typically only
	  enabled for developers or devices where the sound card is
	  controlled externally
          Say Y if you need this nocodec fallback option
          If unsure select "N".

config SND_SOC_SOF_FORCE_NOCODEC_MODE
	tristate "SOF force nocodec Mode"
	depends on SND_SOC_SOF_NOCODEC
	help
          This forces SOF to use dummy/nocodec as machine driver, even
	  though there is a codec detected on the real platform. This is
	  typically only enabled for developers for debug purposes, before
	  codec/machine driver is ready, or to exclude the impact of those
	  drivers
          Say Y if you need this force nocodec mode option
          If unsure select "N".
