		This is the Intel I210 Ethernet driver that lives
		at https://github.com/AVnu/OpenAvnu/tree/master/
		kmod/igb. Note that this is different from drivers/
		net/ethernet/intel/igb. It can be used for developing
		Audio/Video Bridging applications, Industrial Ethernet
		applications which require precise timing control over
		frame transmission, or test harnesses for measuring system
		latencies and sampling events. It is exclusive with the
		in-tree IGB driver, so only one of them can be enabled
		at any point in time.

		To build this as a module, say M, if not sure say N.
